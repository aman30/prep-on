        Below there is a slider focussing on the newest features and addition of all test and materials.
        As you move down a little bit you will find a section (Popular test series), moving more downwards there is a section for
        about us and then our team and a section of top post from the blog and then testimonials.
        
Step 3: Describng the funnctions of the tabs :
